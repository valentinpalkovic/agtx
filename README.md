## Why agtx?

AI coding tools give you one agent, one task, one terminal. agtx gives you a **kanban board where multiple coding agents work in parallel** — each in its own git worktree, each in its own tmux window, running autonomously through a spec-driven workflow managed by an orchestrator agent.

When ideas come up mid-session, `/agtx:brainstorm` keeps your agent in exploration mode — then `/agtx:sweep` turns the conversation into board tasks with a single confirmation step. **No context switching, no copy-pasting — ideas flow directly into work.**

With the orchestrator, you don't even manage the board yourself. **An AI agent picks up tasks, delegates work, and ensures getting things done** through planning, implementation, review and resolving conflicts — while you focus on what matters: research, defining tasks, and merging changes.

> [!TIP]
> Check out the [Contributing](#contributing) section or have a look at [`good first issues`](https://github.com/fynnfluegge/agtx/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) to get involved and become a contributor ⭐️ 

## Features

- **Orchestrator agent**: A dedicated AI agent that autonomously manages your kanban board via [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) — delegates to coding agents, advances phases, checks for merge conflicts ([experimental](#orchestrator-agent-experimental))
- **Brainstorm & Sweep skills**: Capture ideas and push them to the board from any coding agent session — `/agtx:brainstorm` to explore freely, `/agtx:sweep` to decompose and create tasks with one confirmation step ([details](#brainstorm--sweep-skills))
- **Multi-agent task lifecycle**: Configure different agents per workflow phase — e.g. Gemini for research, Claude for implementation, Codex for review — with automatic agent switching
- **Parallel execution**: Every task gets its own git worktree and tmux window — run as many agents as needed, simultaneously
- **Spec-driven plugins**: Plug in [GSD](https://github.com/fynnfluegge/get-shit-done-cc), [Spec-kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit), [OpenSpec](https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec), [BMAD](https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD), [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) — or define your own with a single TOML file
- **Multi-project dashboard**: Manage agent sessions across all projects via a single TUI
- **Works with**: [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) | [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) | [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) | [OpenCode](https://github.com/sst/opencode)  | [Cursor Agent](https://cursor.com/docs/cli/overview) | [Copilot](https://github.com/github/copilot-cli)

> [!NOTE]
> Just need a plain coding agent session manager with **full human-in-the-loop control** and **no automatic spec-driven skill execution and orchestration** on advancing tasks?
>
> Choose the **`void` plugin** and enjoy the kanban coding agent board - with full human control.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fynnfluegge/agtx/main/install.sh | bash

# Run in any git repository
cd your-project && agtx
```

```bash
# Dashboard mode — manage all projects
agtx -g

# Orchestrator mode — let an AI manage the board for you
agtx --experimental
```

> [!NOTE]
> Add `.agtx/` to your project's `.gitignore` to avoid committing worktrees and local task data.

```bash
# Install from source
cargo build --release
cp target/release/agtx ~/.local/bin/
```

### Requirements

- **tmux** — agent sessions run in a dedicated tmux server
- **gh** (optional) — GitHub CLI for PR operations

## Usage

<details>
<summary><strong>Keyboard Shortcuts</strong></summary>

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `h/l` or `←/→` | Move between columns |
| `j/k` or `↑/↓` | Move between tasks |
| `o` | Create new task |
| `R` | Enter research mode |
| `↩` | Open task (view agent session) |
| `Ctrl+f` | Fullscreen attach to task's tmux session |
| `m` | Move task forward in workflow |
| `r` | Resume task (Review → Running) / Move back (Running → Planning) |
| `p` | Next phase (Review → Planning, cyclic plugins only) |
| `d` | Show git diff |
| `x` | Delete task |
| `/` | Search tasks |
| `P` | Select spec-driven workflow plugin |
| `O` | Toggle orchestrator agent (`--experimental`) |
| `e` | Toggle project sidebar |
| `q` | Quit |

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Task Creation Wizard</strong></summary>

Press `o` to create a new task. The wizard guides you through:
1. **Title** — enter a short task name
2. **Plugin** — select a workflow plugin (auto-skipped if only one option)
3. **Prompt** — write a detailed task description with inline references

The agent is configured at the project level via `config.toml` (not per-task).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Task Description Editor</strong></summary>

When writing a task description, you can reference files, skills, and other tasks inline:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `#` or `@` | Fuzzy search and insert a file path |
| `/` | Fuzzy search and insert an agent skill/command (at line start or after space) |
| `!` | Fuzzy search and insert a task reference (at line start or after space) |

</details>

### Agent Sessions

Each task runs in its own tmux window with a dedicated coding agent. The session persists across the entire task lifecycle — you can open the task popup at any time to see live agent output, or press `Ctrl+f` to attach fullscreen.

- **Persistent context**: The agent's full conversation history is preserved across Planning → Running → Review
- **Resume from Review**: Moving a task back to Running simply reconnects to the existing session — no re-initialization needed
- **Inline view**: Press `↩` on any active task to open a scrollable tmux view inside the TUI
- **Fullscreen**: Press `Ctrl+f` to attach directly to the agent's tmux window
- **Auto merge-conflict resolution**: When a Review task becomes idle, agtx checks for merge conflicts with the default branch using a non-destructive virtual merge (`git merge-tree`). If conflicts are detected, the agent is automatically sent the `/agtx:merge-conflicts` skill to resolve them and re-commit

## Brainstorm & Sweep Skills

Two companion skills for capturing ideas in any coding agent session and turning them into tasks in the agtx board.

| Skill | Command | When to use |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Brainstorm** | `/agtx:brainstorm` | Explore a feature idea — discussion only, no planning or implementation |
| **Sweep** | `/agtx:sweep` | Push conversation outcomes to the agtx board as tasks |

**Typical flow:**
```
/agtx:brainstorm   ← explore the idea freely
      ↓
/agtx:sweep        ← extract tasks, confirm, push to board
      ↓
agtx board         ← tasks appear in Backlog, ready to advance
```

The brainstorm skill keeps the agent in discussion mode — asking questions, surfacing trade-offs, no code or plans. When the conversation feels complete, run `/agtx:sweep` to decompose outcomes into feature-level tasks and push them to the board with a single confirmation step.

### Install

<details>
<summary><strong>Claude Code</strong></summary>

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add fynnfluegge/agtx
claude plugin install agtx@agtx-marketplace
claude mcp add --scope user agtx -- agtx mcp-serve
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Codex</strong></summary>

```bash
codex mcp add agtx -- agtx mcp-serve
```

Add to your project's `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`:
```json
{
  "name": "local-repo",
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "agtx",
      "source": {
        "source": "local",
        "path": "./plugins/agtx"
      },
      "policy": {
        "installation": "AVAILABLE",
        "authentication": "ON_INSTALL"
      },
      "category": "Productivity"
    }
  ]
}
```

Then in any Codex session: `@agtx:sweep` / `@agtx:brainstorm`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Gemini CLI</strong></summary>

```bash
gemini mcp add agtx -- agtx mcp-serve
echo "@skills/sweep/SKILL.md" >> ~/GEMINI.md
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Cursor</strong></summary>

```bash
cursor mcp add agtx -- agtx mcp-serve
cp skills/sweep/SKILL.md ~/.cursor/rules/agtx-sweep.md
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Other</strong></summary>

Register `agtx mcp-serve` as an MCP server, then copy `skills/sweep/SKILL.md` into your agent's context.

</details>

> [!NOTE]
> The project must have been opened in agtx at least once to appear in `list_projects`. Run `agtx` in your project directory first.

## Configuration

Config file location: `~/.config/agtx/config.toml`

### Worktree Base Branch

agtx creates a new git worktree for each task. By default it auto-detects the base branch in this
order: `main`, then `master`, then the current branch. You can override this to force a specific
base branch (for example `dev` or `develop`).

Global worktree defaults can be set here:

```toml
# ~/.config/agtx/config.toml
[worktree]
base_branch = "dev"
worktree_dir = ".worktrees"  # default: ".agtx/worktrees"
```

`worktree_dir` is the directory (relative to project root) where task worktrees are created. Defaults
to `.agtx/worktrees` if not set.

### Project Configuration

Per-project settings can be placed in `.agtx/config.toml` at the project root:

```toml
# Base branch used when creating new task worktrees (optional)
base_branch = "dev"

# Directory where worktrees are created (optional, default: ".agtx/worktrees")
worktree_dir = ".worktrees"

# Files to copy from project root into each new worktree (comma-separated)
# Paths are relative and preserve directory structure
copy_files = ".env, .env.local, web/.env.local"

# Shell command to run inside the worktree after creation and file copying
init_script = "scripts/init_worktree.sh"

# Shell command to run inside the worktree before removal
cleanup_script = "scripts/cleanup_worktree.sh"
```

`base_branch` controls which branch new task worktrees are created from. If omitted or empty, agtx
auto-detects `main`, `master`, or falls back to the current branch.

### Per-Phase Agent Configuration

By default, all phases use `default_agent`. You can override the agent for specific phases globally or per project:

```toml
# ~/.config/agtx/config.toml
default_agent = "claude"

[agents]
research = "gemini"
planning = "claude"
running = "claude"
review = "codex"
```

```toml
# .agtx/config.toml (project override — takes precedence over global)
[agents]
running = "codex"
```

<details>
<summary><b>Creating a Plugin</b></summary>

> [!TIP]
> If you have the agtx repo open in Claude Code, run `/add-plugin <github-url>` to automatically generate a bundled `plugin.toml` from any spec-driven framework repo — including wiring up `src/skills.rs` and the README tables.

Place your plugin at `.agtx/plugins/<name>/plugin.toml` in your project root (or `~/.config/agtx/plugins/<name>/plugin.toml` for global use). It will appear in the plugin selector automatically.

**Minimal example** — a plugin that uses custom slash commands:

```toml
name = "my-plugin"
description = "My custom workflow"

[commands]
research = "/my-plugin:research {task}"
planning = "/my-plugin:plan"
running = "/my-plugin:execute"
review = "/my-plugin:review"

[prompts]
planning = "Task: {task}"
```

**Full reference** with all available fields:

```toml
name = "my-plugin"
description = "My custom workflow"

# Shell command to run in the worktree after creation, before the agent starts.
# {agent} is replaced with the agent name (claude, codex, gemini, etc.)
init_script = "npm install --prefix .my-plugin --{agent}"

# Restrict to specific agents (empty or omitted = all agents supported)
supported_agents = ["claude", "codex", "gemini", "opencode"]

# Extra directories to copy from project root into each worktree.
# Agent config dirs (.claude, .gemini, .codex, .github/agents, .config/opencode)
# are always copied automatically.
copy_dirs = [".my-plugin"]

# Individual files to copy from project root into each worktree.
# Merged with project-level copy_files from .agtx/config.toml.
copy_files = ["PROJECT.md", "REQUIREMENTS.md"]

# When true, enables Review → Planning transition via the `p` key.
# Each cycle increments the phase counter ({phase} placeholder).
# Use this for multi-milestone workflows (e.g. plan → execute → review → next milestone).
cyclic = false

# Artifact files that signal phase completion.
# When detected, the task shows a checkmark instead of the spinner.
# Supports * wildcard for one directory level (e.g. "specs/*/plan.md").
# Use {phase} for cycle-aware paths (replaced with the current cycle number).
# Omitted phases show no completion indicator.
[artifacts]
research = ".my-plugin/research.md"
planning = ".my-plugin/{phase}/plan.md"
running = ".my-plugin/{phase}/summary.md"
review = ".my-plugin/{phase}/review.md"

# Slash commands sent to the agent via tmux for each phase.
# Written in canonical format (Claude/Gemini style): /namespace:command
# Automatically transformed per agent:
#   Claude/Gemini: /my-plugin:plan (unchanged)
#   OpenCode:      /my-plugin-plan (colon -> hyphen)
#   Codex:         $my-plugin-plan (slash -> dollar, colon -> hyphen)
# Omitted phases fall back to agent-native agtx skill invocation
# (e.g. /agtx:plan for Claude, $agtx-plan for Codex).
# Set to "" to skip sending a command for that phase.
# Use {phase} for cycle-aware commands (replaced with the current cycle number).
# Use {task} to inline the task description.
[commands]
preresearch = "/my-plugin:research {task}"  # Used only when no research artifacts exist yet
research = "/my-plugin:discuss {phase}"
planning = "/my-plugin:plan {phase}"
running = "/my-plugin:execute {phase}"
review = "/my-plugin:review {phase}"

# Prompt templates sent as task content after the command.
# {task} = task title + description, {task_id} = unique task ID, {phase} = cycle number.
# Omitted phases send no prompt (the skill/command handles instructions).
[prompts]
research = "Task: {task}"

# Text patterns to wait for in the tmux pane before sending the prompt.
# Useful when a command triggers an interactive prompt that must appear first.
# Polls every 500ms, times out after 5 minutes.
[prompt_triggers]
research = "What do you want to build?"

# Files/dirs to copy from worktree back to project root after a phase completes.
# Triggered automatically when the phase artifact is detected (spinner → checkmark).
# Useful for sharing research artifacts (specs, plans) across worktrees.
[copy_back]
research = ["PROJECT.md", "REQUIREMENTS.md", ".my-plugin"]

# Auto-dismiss interactive prompts that appear before the prompt trigger.
# Each rule fires when ALL detect patterns are present and the pane is stable.
# Response is newline-separated keystrokes (e.g. "2\nEnter" sends "2" then Enter).
[[auto_dismiss]]
detect = ["Map codebase", "Skip mapping", "Enter to select"]
response = "2\nEnter"
```

**What happens at each phase transition:**

1. The **command** is sent to the agent via tmux (e.g., `/my-plugin:plan`)
2. If a **prompt_trigger** is set, agtx waits for that prompt trigger to appear in the tmux pane
3. The **prompt** is sent with `{task}`, `{task_id}`, and `{phase}` replaced
4. agtx polls for the **artifact** file — when found, the spinner becomes a checkmark
5. If **copy_back** is configured, artifacts are copied from worktree to project root on completion
6. If the agent appears idle (no output for 15s), the spinner becomes a pause icon

**Phase gating:** Whether a phase can be entered directly from Backlog is derived from the plugin config. If a phase's command or prompt contains `{task}`, it can receive task context and is accessible from Backlog. If neither has `{task}`, the phase depends on a prior phase and is blocked until that artifact exists. For example, OpenSpec's `/opsx:propose {task}` allows direct Backlog → Planning, but `/opsx:apply` (no `{task}`) blocks Backlog → Running until proposal artifacts exist.

**Preresearch fallback:** When pressing `R` on a task, if `preresearch` is configured and no research artifacts from `copy_back` exist in the project root yet, the `preresearch` command is used instead of `research`. This lets plugins run a one-time project setup (e.g. `/gsd:new-project`) before switching to the regular research command for subsequent tasks. If the plugin has no research command at all (e.g. OpenSpec), pressing `R` shows a warning.

**Cyclic workflows:** When `cyclic = true`, pressing `p` in Review moves the task back to Planning with an incremented phase counter. This enables multi-milestone workflows where each cycle (plan → execute → review) produces artifacts in a separate `{phase}` directory.

**Custom skills:** If your plugin provides its own skill files, place them in the plugin directory:

```
.agtx/plugins/my-plugin/
├── plugin.toml
└── skills/
    ├── agtx-plan/SKILL.md
    ├── agtx-execute/SKILL.md
    └── agtx-review/SKILL.md
```

These override the built-in agtx skills and are automatically deployed to each agent's native discovery path (`.claude/commands/`, `.codex/skills/`, `.gemini/commands/`, etc.) in every worktree.

### Tmux Structure

- **Server**: All sessions run on a dedicated tmux server named `agtx`
- **Sessions**: Each project gets its own tmux session (named after the project)
- **Windows**: Each task gets its own window within the project's session

```bash
# List all sessions
tmux -L agtx list-sessions

# List all windows across sessions
tmux -L agtx list-windows -a

# Attach to the agtx server
tmux -L agtx attach
```

### Data Storage

- **Database**: `~/Library/Application Support/agtx/` (macOS) or `~/.config/agtx/` (Linux)
- Config: `~/.config/agtx/config.toml`
- **Worktrees**: `.agtx/worktrees/` in each project
- **Tmux**: Dedicated server `agtx` with per-project sessions

Run agtx in an isolated Docker container so agents can only touch the project you pass in — no access to the rest of your home directory, credentials are read-only, and any files the agent creates in the project are owned by your host user.

```bash
# Run agtx on a project
./docker/sandbox.sh path/to/your-project

# Or from inside the project directory
./docker/sandbox.sh
```

The sandbox:
- Mounts only the target project as writable; everything else on the host is inaccessible
- Copies `~/.claude` credentials read-only at startup so they are never written back to the host
- Runs as a non-root user whose UID/GID matches your host user (files created inside the container appear correctly owned on the host)
- Stores agtx state in named Docker volumes (persists across runs, isolated from your host's agtx data)
- Pre-accepts the bypass permissions prompt, which is appropriate in an isolated container

> [!NOTE]
> Requires [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) (Linux) or [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) (macOS/Windows). The image is built automatically on first run and cached for subsequent runs.

## MCP Server

The agtx MCP server (`agtx mcp-serve`) exposes the board to any coding agent session via the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io). Used by the orchestrator agent and the brainstorm & sweep skills.

### Modes

| Mode | Command | Used by |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Global** | `agtx mcp-serve` | Sweep/brainstorm skills — works across all projects |
| **Project-scoped** | `agtx mcp-serve <path>` | Orchestrator — bound to one project at startup |

In global mode all tools require a `project_id` parameter. Call `list_projects` first to resolve it.

### Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `list_projects` | List all projects indexed in agtx |
| `list_tasks` | List tasks, optionally filtered by status |
| `get_task` | Get task details + `allowed_actions` for valid transitions |
| `create_task` | Create a single backlog task |
| `create_tasks_batch` | Batch-create tasks with index-based dependencies |
| `update_task` | Modify a backlog task (title, description, deps) |
| `delete_task` | Delete a backlog task |
| `move_task` | Queue a phase transition |
| `get_transition_status` | Check if a queued transition completed or errored |
| `check_conflicts` | Non-destructive merge conflict check against default branch |
| `get_notifications` | Fetch pending orchestrator notifications |
| `read_pane_content` | Read the last N lines of a task's tmux pane |
| `send_to_task` | Send a message to a task's agent pane |

## Orchestrator Agent (Experimental)

> Press `O` and walk away. Come back to changes ready to merge.

The orchestrator is an AI agent that **drives other AI agents to completion**. You triage tasks into Planning or Running — the orchestrator takes over from there, advancing each task through its phases until it lands in Review, ready for you to merge.

```bash
agtx --experimental   # then press O
```

**What it does:**
- Monitors tasks in Planning and Running
- Advances tasks automatically as phases complete (Planning → Running → Review)
- Respects plugin phase rules — checks `allowed_actions` before each transition
- Detects stuck tasks (idle for 1+ minute without a phase artifact) and reads the agent pane to diagnose the cause
- Nudges stuck agents, answers CLI prompts automatically, or escalates to you with a reason when human input is needed

**You triage. It executes.** Move tasks from Backlog into Planning or Running — the orchestrator handles the rest. Merging is your call.

### MCP Integration

The orchestrator communicates with agtx through the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io). agtx ships with a built-in MCP server (`agtx serve`) that exposes the kanban board as a set of tools over JSON-RPC via stdio.

```
┌─────────────-┐     MCP (stdio)     ┌──────────────┐     SQLite     ┌─────┐
│ Orchestrator │ ←─────────────────→ │  MCP Server  │ ←────────────→ │ DB  │
│ (Claude Code)│                     │ (agtx serve) │                └──┬──┘
└──────┬───────┘                     └──────────────┘                   │
       │  push-when-idle notifications                                  │
┌──────┴───────┐                                                        │
│   TUI (agtx) │ ←───────────────────────────────────────────────────--─┘
└──────────────┘
```

**How it works:**
1. When you press `O`, the TUI registers the MCP server with the orchestrator agent via `claude mcp add-json --scope local`
2. The orchestrator receives phase completion notifications pushed to its tmux pane when idle
3. It reacts by calling `get_task` to check `allowed_actions`, then `move_task` to advance the task
4. The TUI processes the transition request, executes all side effects (agent switching, skill deployment, prompt sending), and updates the database
5. If a task has been idle for 1+ minute without a phase artifact, the orchestrator is notified — it reads the pane with `read_pane_content`, then either nudges the agent with `send_to_task` or calls `move_task` with `escalate_to_user` to flag it for your attention
6. Escalated tasks show a `⚠` badge on the kanban board; opening the task popup shows the reason and dismisses the flag
7. MCP registration is cleaned up when the orchestrator is stopped

## Benchmark

agtx includes a [SWE-bench Lite](https://www.swebench.com) benchmark runner that uses agtx itself as the agent orchestration layer — driving coding agent workflows against 300 real GitHub bug-fix tasks via the MCP server.

See **[benchmark/README.md](benchmark/README.md)** for setup, usage, bundled configs, and evaluation instructions.
